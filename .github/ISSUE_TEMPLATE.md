Thank you for making your time and reporting the issue. I can't possibly test on all devices, so it is easy for me to overlook
bugs which may cause PhotoCloud to be unusable on your device. Also, everybody will benefit from the fixed bug or a new feature.

PhotoCloud includes an automatized bug reporting system, so it is possible that I already have a bug report and I'm
working on a fix. Yet, still please feel free to create a bug and attach a screenshot of the bug, and steps which lead to the
bug.

Please, if the issue is fixed for you, I urge you to change the rating. One-star ratings discourage new users from
using PhotoCloud. That means less bugs reported and fixed, less features asked and implemented, and I get paid
less which discourages me from implementing more features. Thanks!
