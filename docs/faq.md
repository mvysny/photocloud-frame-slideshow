# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## ChromeCast icon not shown

When you start the slideshow, just touch the image, to pause the slideshow and to reveal more controls:

<img src="images/chromecast.jpg" width="180px">

The upper bar shows the following action buttons:

* The *Share button* which allows you to share the image to other apps
* The *Keep Screen* On button which leaves the screen on, or allows the screen to go off during the slideshow
* The *Set As Wallpaper* button which sets current photo as a background
* Finally, the *Chromecast* button which casts the slideshow to your chromecast device as well. Note that
  the Chromecast button is only visible when your phone actually sees the Chromecast device (the Chromecast device is on
  and the phone is connected to the same wifi as the Chromecast device itself). **Note**: the Chromecast connectivity
  and the Chromecast button visibility is completely in control of Google's code - the PhotoCloud app can not show/hide the button
  itself. If the button is hidden even though Chromecast is on, then there is nothing I can do.
  Please report a bug to Google guys.

The lower bar with the up-arrow will reveal the detailed EXIF data upon touch.

## Slideshow from a subfolder

There are two ways to achieve this:

* One-time: just touch the Stream card, to reveal the *Browse* button; then use the Browser to locate the directory.
  Long-touch the directory and select the *Slideshow* option. That will start slideshow from that folder only.
  
* By default, choosing the *Slideshow* from the Stream card menu will slideshow all photos in that Stream.
  To limit the slideshow to only particular subfolder, *Browse* the Stream and locate the directory.
  Then, long-touch the directory and select the *Root Stream Here* option. From now on, this Stream slideshows
  will only show this folder. You can add additional folders; slideshow will then show photos from all of these folders.
  The folders will be listed in the Stream Card; just press the blue trash bin icon to remove those folders.

## Slideshow from multiple Streams

Just touch the Stream icon, located to the left corner of the Stream card.

The main screen listing four stream cards:

<img src="images/stream_cards.jpg" width="180px">

You will be able to check multiple streams; then just touch the upper-right *Start Slideshow* button
to start slideshow from all of those streams.

## Adding more Streams

Open the main screen and touch the lower big white plus button. You will be able to add additional streams.

## Settings

Touch the upper-right cog wheel *Settings* button in the main screen. You can for example configure to
start slideshow from a Stream (or a combination of Streams)

* When your device boots;
* When your power cable is plugged in;

And others.
